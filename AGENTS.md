# Agent Guidelines

## Respect Requested Scope
- Only edit the code sections the user explicitly asks you to change.
- If you believe additional changes are necessary, describe them and wait for approval before making them.
- Leave all other parts of the codebase untouched unless the user expands the request.

## Top-Level Directories
| Directory           | Purpose                                             |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `DesktopSetup`      | Desktop environment setup and maintenance scripts   |
| `docker-containers` | Docker container deployment scripts and references  |
| `Media`             | Utilities for handling media files                  |
| `Ollama`            | Scripts for installing or managing Ollama tooling   |
| `proxmox`           | Proxmox automation scripts and VM resources         |

## Code Style
- Markdown tables should be nicely formatted in the code.
